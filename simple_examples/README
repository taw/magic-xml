These examples show many different ways of using magic/xml for trivial things.

_o - naive object-oriented
_f - functional
_m - monadic

xhtml_ - uses XHTML module
xml_   - does not use XHTML module

Tasks:
* Generating simple XML of pre-defined structure
* Converting an Array to XHTML list

[This is lame, more realistic examples are needed]
