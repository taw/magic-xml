Use Case "PARTS" - Recursive Parts Explosion
from XML Query Use Cases.

Q1 - Convert the sample document from "partlist"
     format to "parttree" format (see DTD section
     for definitions). In the result document,
     part containment is represented by containment
     of one <part> element inside another. Each part
     that is not part of any other part should appear
     as a separate top-level element in the output document.
